This is a fork of the popular veins project where I attempt malicious message detection using a range of techniques and then test them against sample malicious messages to see how they hold up.

This is done by extendig the Traci example module and then using that module in my example Vanet_sim project folder which has a basic osm simulation loaded also.

To use this, please import this project as you would import a normal veins project into omnetpp and then navigate to the examples folder and compile the Vanet_sim project.

The original veins documentation and licensing is below:

Veins - The open source vehicular network simulation framework.

See the Veins website <http://veins.car2x.org/> for a tutorial, documentation,
and publications.
